<h1 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<a href="#" class="faq-expand">Expand All</a>
<section class="faqs container-fluid">
<h2 class="faq-section">Purchasing</h2>
<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Where can I buy ecovent?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">We are currently working with beta customers who are interested in using the product before it is widely available. Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@ecoventsystems.com">info@ecoventsystems.com</a> if you would like to join our beta program.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">How much does the system cost?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Every home is different, so your costs will vary based on the size of the home and your current heating and cooling needs. </p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Does the system pay for itself through energy savings? What’s the payback period?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Most homes will shrink their utility bill by using ecovent. Under normal use, we project the system can pay for itself in less than three years. If your utility costs are higher than average, the payback period improves.</p>

<h2 class="faq-section">Installation</h2>
<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">How do I install the system?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Installation is simple. For each room in your home, just plug in a sensor in an outlet and replace your vents with ours. No special tools necessary. The system immediately begins calibrating itself by learning the characteristics of your home and your usual heating and cooling needs.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">How long does it take to install?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Less than ten minutes per room. If you’ve got hard-to-reach vents, you should plan for a few extra minutes. The whole thing should take no more than an afternoon.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Who can install ecovent? Do I need a professional?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">We designed ecovent to be easy to install. Anyone can do it. But if you want someone else to handle it for you, we’re happy to connect you to an ecovent-certified installer in your area. Email us at <a href="mailto:info@ecoventsystems.com">info@ecoventsystems.com</a> for details</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Do I have to upgrade every vent in my home?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">ecovent scales to fit any size home. If you’ve got a big house and don’t want to upgrade the whole home at the same time, we recommend that you do at least one zone. Performance and comfort will improve as you add more of our vents.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">I rent my apartment. Can I still install the system?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">You should definitely check with your landlord first. That said, ecovent is great for apartments, since you and your roommates won’t have to fight over the thermostat. Even better, if you ever move, it’s easy to bring the system with you to your new place.</p>

<p class="faq-text">But first check your lease and always ask your landlord before you do anything to your apartment.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">I’m a contractor or home builder and want to sell this system. Who should I talk to?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Great! Email us at <a href="mailto:partners@ecoventsystems">partners@ecoventsystems</a>.</p>

<h2 class="faq-section">Design & Features</h2>
<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Can I control the system from my phone?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Absolutely. Our system is adaptive, and it will begin to learn what settings make you comfortable automatically. But if you want, you can control the temperature in each room, turn your thermostat on and off, and see the status of every room your house. Be comfortable when you get home from work, or amaze your friends at parties. You’re going to like this feature.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What kinds of mobile phones, tablets, and platforms will you support?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">iOS (iPhone, iPad) or Android.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">How are the vents powered?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">The vents are battery powered. Under normal conditions, the batteries will last more than two years. We’re using standard battery sizes you can buy at any corner store.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">How do I change the batteries?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Simple. Just remove the faceplate from the vent, pop out the batteries, and replace them with new ones. Your eight-year-old can do it. </p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">How do I know if the batteries need to be replaced?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">The ecovent app will send you a notification weeks in advance, telling you that the batteries are low.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What kinds of sensors are included?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Temperature, humidity, pressure, and occupancy. Each of these sensors helps us tailor the temperature of every room to its specific conditions.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Where do the sensors go? How do you install them?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">The sensors plug into any power outlet in your home, but if you’re thinking “big ugly wall wort,” stop right there. The plugs are designed so they won’t take up any of your outlets, and in fact, they give you more space to plug in your gadgets through USB charging ports.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What sizes do the vents come in?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">We plan to offer vents in the most popular sizes for floor, wall, and ceiling vents. Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ecoventsystems.com">info@ecoventsystems.com</a> for custom sizing.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Do you offer different vents or faceplates?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Our faceplates are designed to optimize airflow. They were designed by a rocket scientist (literally). There are different faceplate designs depending on where your vents are located. We’re focused on delivering air efficiently and in style. We’ll offer different colors and styles in the future.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">I’ve heard closing vents is bad for your heating and cooling system?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Funny you should ask. We just published a whitepaper on this topic. It is bad when you don’t monitor system conditions. That’s where ecovent steps in. Our system can address those concerns safely.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Do you offer “themed” control or pre-programmed settings for dinner parties, movie nights, weekend mornings?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Yes. Activities and events are on the product roadmap.</p>

<h2 class="faq-section">Compatibility</h2>
<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Can I use my existing thermostat with ecovent? I’ve got a Honeywell, Nest, etc...</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Short answer is yes. Longer answer: We’re planning to integrate as seamlessly as possible with as many thermostat makers as possible. That includes the leading “learning thermostat” manufacturers. If there’s a particular vendor you want us to prioritize, please let us know. But chances are, if you’ve heard of them, they’re on our roadmap.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What kind of HVAC system do I need to use ecovent?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">You need a forced air (central) system. ecovent will not work with radiant heat, ductless systems, and window units.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Does your system include a thermostat?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">If you do not have a compatible wireless thermostat, or you want to upgrade, we do provide compatible models.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What if my thermostat doesn’t integrate with ecovent?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Every thermostat will work with ecovent. But just because it works doesn’t mean it’s working at optimal efficiency. We recommend upgrading.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">I already have multiple zones in my home, can ecovent still help me?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Even if you have a 15-zone home, you’ve probably got rooms that are hotter and colder than others. ecovent will provide that next level of control. In addition, our system understands the interactions between those zones better than any other product on the market.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Will your system integrate with other home automation platforms (SmartThings, WigWag, iControl, Control4, StaplesConnect, AT&T/Verizon/Comcast)?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Total integration is on our roadmap, but in the short term, we’re focused on building a product that works out of the box. Integration is an inevitable next step. </p>

<h2 class="faq-section">Connectivity</h2>
<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What communications protocol are you using?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">WiFi, just like your laptop.</p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">What happens if the WiFi signal drops out or my internet connection goes down?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Don’t worry. Even if your internet signal drops out, ecovent will always work locally. Some features like remote control from phones and apps may not be available when your WiFi is out and you may miss out on firmware updates in the meantime. But your heating and cooling will operate normally. </p>

<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Are there firmware updates? Or, what are firmware updates?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">Yep.We can upgrade the firmware remotely. Firmware is the embedded software that controls our hardware. Every update to this special software increases the functionality of your system.</p>

<h2 class="faq-section">Everything Else</h2>
<span class="faq-trigger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><h3 class="faq-question">Are you taking beta testers?</h3></span><br />
<p class="faq-text">We are - please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@ecoventsystems.com">info@ecoventsystems.com</a></p>
